Introduction
============
CEImagesetEditor originally started life as a CEGUI community project by
Martin Fleurent (martignasse).  Development was fast paced at first, but alas
things eventually slowed to a halt.

Due to the need for some kind of tool set for Crazy Eddie's GUI System, the
CEGUI Team decided to revive this project and to develop and maintain it
directly.

We would like to take this opportunity to thank martignasse for his efforts
with this tool; without that initial work there would be no CEImagesetEditor.


The following is a list of primary authors and contributors for CEImagesetEditor:
